Movie Insight 

Movie Insight is an end-to-end machine learning project that predicts whether a movie is worth watching based on its storyline. The system uses Natural Language Processing techniques with TF-IDF vectorization and a Logistic Regression classifier trained on movie overview data.

The project includes the complete machine learning pipeline, covering data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and persistence. Predictions are available through both a command-line interface and a desktop GUI application built with CustomTkinter, demonstrating real-world model deployment.

The application provides prediction results along with confidence scores and overall model accuracy, and is designed with modular, reusable components. This project highlights practical skills in machine learning, NLP, Python development, and GUI-based application integration.
